## Founder’s Story

### From Digital Artist to Tech Entrepreneur

Before I wrote a single line of code, I was already creating. I started as a digital artist and animator—drawing scenes in **Ibis Paint**, bringing them to life in **FlipaClip**. By 14, I built my first web app: **Artigram**, an Instagram clone that changed everything.

- **Age 14 — Artigram.rf.gd**  
  I launched my first social platform from scratch. It wasn’t perfect—but it worked, and it ignited my passion for building systems.

- **Maker Spirit — GAMWORD**  
  I designed and developed www.gamword.org and app.gamword.org using the TALL stack, handling backend, frontend, and deployment end to end.

- **Fixer & Backend Architect**  
  I’ve debugged and optimized dozens of Laravel applications, refining codebases for speed, scalability, and clarity.

- **Inkreo & Membo**  
  I cofounded Membo.club as Backend Lead—building its real-time feed and moderation tools—and now lead Inkreo as Founder & CEO alongside frontend lead Abdulazeez Mumuni.

- **Community Architect — BuildCabal**  
  I created BuildCabal, uniting Certified Coders Club, The Exploit Lab, Robotics Workshop, and The Startup Circle to foster collaboration across tech disciplines.

> _I don’t just build apps—I build spaces, tools, and communities where creativity meets code and great ideas come alive._

## Inkreo

### Redefining the Art of Writing

> “Writing isn’t just about words—it’s about ideas, structure, and speed. Inkreo is the AI-powered writing platform that helps you think, draft, and polish like never before.”

I started Inkreo because I was tired of juggling writing tools and research tabs. Inkreo brings intelligent assistance—rewriting, grammar fixes, smart templates, and built-in research—all in one place.

**What Makes Inkreo Different**  
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Rewrite, paraphrase, and correct grammar inline.  
- **Smart Templates**: Generate document structures from your prompts.  
- **Distraction-Free Editor**: Clean, modern UI.  
- **Built-in Research Companion**: Research and cite without leaving the editor.  
- **Beautiful Rich Text Output**: Polished documents out of the box.

**Built by a Focused Team**  
> I lead backend & API development as Founder & CEO, with Abdulazeez Mumuni driving frontend & UX.
